# Stacks Regtest Environment
This project aims to simplify the process of configuring and running a [Stacks Blockchain](https://www.stacks.co/) `regtest` environment.

This application is an assortment of `bash` scripts which provide a clean interface over a number of different tools. While POSIX `sh` compatability isn't far away, I chose `bash` as it's still very widespread and there are some nice features for larger shellscript applications.

## Requirements
This application requires the following dependencies on the local machine:
- bash
- docker (& compose)

## How it Works

### Docker
The scripts make heavy use of Docker to both build and run environments.

All container details can be found in the `Dockerfile` which uses multi-stage/multi-target as we're building a number of binaries used in several final images.

Here's a summary of the build stages:
- `bitcoin-build`: This stage downloads and extracts the Bitcoin Core binaries for the specified Bitcoin version. By default, the binaries are retrieved from bitcoincore.org, this can however be overridden in the `.env` file.
- `bitcoind`: This is the final Bitcoin node image. We only copy the required binaries from `bitcoin-build` to keep the size down, and we copy our local assets.
- `stacks-build`: This is the "big one". Here we pull down all of the Stacks-related source code and build `stacks-node` (twice - once for `2.4` and once for `nakamoto`), `stacks-signer`, `clarinet`, `blockstack-cli` and `sbtc` binaries. This build stage will take a while on the first run :)
- `stacks-node`: This is the runtime image for Stacks nodes and signers. This image contains both the `2.4` and `nakamoto` versions of `stacks-node`, `blockstack-cli` as well as `sbtc` and `bitcoin-cli`.
- `clarinet`: This image contains the `clarinet` binary and is used to interact with contracts within the environment.

Containers are labeled with a few Stacks-specific labels to help us distinguish between services:
- `local.stacks.environment_id`: The environment id (see [Environments](#environments)).
- `local.stacks.role`: The role of the container (one of `node`, `bitcoind`, `signer`, `environment`).
- `local.stacks.node_version`: The **startup** version of containers with the `node` role. For example, if a `2.4` node is started but is upgraded to a `nakamoto` node, this label will remain `2.4.`. This is used to visualize upgrade paths in the `ls` command.
- `local.stacks.leader`: Indicates whether or not a container with the `node` role is a leader (_miner_) or not (_follower_).

### Environments
This tool uses the concept of _environments_ which keep individual regtest environments isolated from eachother.

Each environment is assigned a unique identifier in the format `yyyyMMddHHmmS`. The script will use this identifier to create a new "assets" directory under `./environments` specific to that environment. All docker containers will also be labeled with `local.stacks.environment_id=REGTEST_ENV_ID` so that we ensure we only touch containers which belong to the environment.

When the environment is starting, first a small `busybox` container (~3MB) will be started and labeled with the above. This container represents the "liveliness" of the environment and simply runs a while/sleep loop until it's killed.

Next, the other requested services will be started as well as a background "monitor" task which both monitors the state of the environment and performs [data synchronization](#data-synchronization) between active services.

### Data Synchronization
_We'll use the **environment id** of `2024010110101` and Docker container id `99e74a576e79` for examples in this section._

#### Mounted Volumes

The logs for running services are mounted to the local `logs` directory associated with the environment. For example, the logs directory for the above example would be `./environments/2024010110101/logs`. 

Each container is responsible for writing its own logs, and for services which can have multiple instances will append their container id to the filename, for example `stacks-node-99e74a576e79.log` for the above container.

#### Synchronized Data

The `monitor.sh` script is responsible for synchronizing data between the host and running services, when an environment is active.

## Usage

```
${USAGE_MAIN}
```

### Starting a New Environment
The `start` command is used to setup and start a new regtest environment. Here's an exerpt from the command's help:
```
${USAGE_START}
```

### Stopping the Environment
The `stop` command is used to stop the environment. Note that environment data will not be automatically cleaned up -- see [cleaning up](#cleaning-up).

### Viewing the Environment
The `ls` command can be used to view the current status of the environment.

Example of a result from `./regtest ls`:
```
NAME                                    ROLE              VERSION
local-stacks-naka-follower-node-1       node              nakamoto
local-stacks-naka-leader-node-1         node (leader)     nakamoto
local-stacks-naka-follower-node-2       node              nakamoto
local-stacks-2.4-leader-node-1          node (leader)     2.4
local-bitcoin-node-1                    bitcoind

This environment has a total of 5 active services (excluding hidden)
```

Note that if a `node` has been upgraded while running, it will be reflected in the `VERSION` column of the table, for example:
```
local-stacks-2.4-leader-node-1          node (leader)     2.4 â‡¾ nakamoto
```

### Cleaning Up
Data will never be automatically removed from environments. However, the `clean` command is available which will remove all stale environment data. Note that if there is currently an running environment, it will **not** be cleaned up.
